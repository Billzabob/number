Contributing
====================

Contributions to `Number` are welcome! I'm particularly interested in
contributions that implement further parts of `ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper`'s
API.

## Standards

1. Submissions must have passing tests
2. Submissions must have complete documentation
3. Discussions must be courteous

I retain the right to refuse to merge functionality which isn't obviously
useful beyond your specific use case. If you disagree, fork away.
